# Web Scraping and Data Extraction

- Developed a Python script to scrape book data from a paginated catalog on the "Books to Scrape" website.
- Implemented a loop to handle multiple pages, utilized requests to fetch HTML content, and parsed it with BeautifulSoup.
- Extracted details such as book titles, ratings, and prices from HTML elements and compiled this information into a list.
- This approach enabled the collection and organization of data from several pages for further analysis.
